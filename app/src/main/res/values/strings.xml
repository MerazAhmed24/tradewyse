    <string name="what_is_macd_description">MACD is a mathematical indicator for stock investors that uses the average closing prices of a stock in 2 timeframes, a short-term (past 9 days) and a longer-term (past 26 days).\n\nWhen the short-term average closing prices (called a moving average) crosses over the longer-term moving average from below heading up, that is a sign to investors to buy the stock.\n\nThe reverse is true when the short-term moving average crosses the longer-term moving average from above heading down. That is a sign to sell the stock.\n\nTradeTips makes knowing when a MACD signal happens by just sending you the list all S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq100 stocks that just had a buy or sell crossover event the day before.</string>
